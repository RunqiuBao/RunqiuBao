- 🌱 I’m currently learning numerical analysis, deep learning with pytorch, advanced c++ courses, computer graphics, etc.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on deep learning-related researches.
- 💬 Ask me about Japanese Anime.
- 📫 How to reach me: I live in Tokyo, usually hanging around Hongo-sancyome; I use wechat the most, add me by searching "mourisan".
